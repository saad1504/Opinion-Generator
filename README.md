# Opinion-Generator

Find people's opinion on any topic of your choice using sentiment anlysis

### To run the following [project](https://github.com/saad1504/Opinion-Generator/blob/master/extractor.py) we need to isntall the following packages

* Tweepy: [tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/) is the python client for the official [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Install it using following pip command:

```javascript pip install tweepy```


* TextBlob: [textblob](http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) is the python library for processing textual data.

Install it using following pip command:

```javascript pip install textblob```


* Also, we need to install some NLTK corpora using following command:

```javascript python -m textblob.download_corpora```

(Corpora is nothing but a large and structured set of texts.)

### All the best :+1:
